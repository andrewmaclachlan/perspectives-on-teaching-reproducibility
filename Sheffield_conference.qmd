## Agendas {.center}

##  {auto-animate="true"}

### Research {auto-animate="true"}

-   To have meaningful real world impact on the sustainability of our cities

-   Operatialising emerging geo-spatial tools for decision making

-   Place *the needs and constraints* of decision makers at the heart of all work

### Research

-   To have meaningful real world impact on the sustainability of our cities

-   Operatialising emerging geo-spatial tools for decision making

-   Place *the needs and constraints* of decision makers at the heart of all work

### Teaching

-   Empower students to become leading activists in urban spatial science

-   Equip students with spatial skills for the interpretation of urban data leading to data-informed decisions

-   Instill critical thought based on a solid theoretical and technical foundation to see through *buzz words and hype* that are often associated with smart cities / urban analytics.

## How do I teach reproducibility and data bias awareness {.center}

::: fragment
### 1. Lead by example
:::

\

::: fragment
### 1b. Listen to Alumni / employers
:::

\

::: fragment
### 2. Don't assess it, **make it mandatory for the assessment\***
:::

## Lead by example

-   Traditional labs and were distributed in pdfs, word documents and powerpoints.

-   Used ArcGIS ðŸ’°

    ![](img/old_pracs.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

## 1. Lead by example

Problems:

::: fragment
-   Static
-   Require updates with software / data
:::

::: fragment
-   Material is in a pdf
-   Not easily searchable, limits it to a *one time use*
:::

::: fragment
-   A lot of time invested
-   Only used by students on the module
:::

::: fragment
> alumni, academia and industry value programmatic and importantly reproducible GIS analysis
:::

## 1b. Listen to Alumni / employers

## Design and outputs

```{=html}
<center><iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/" title="Quarto Documentation"></iframe></center>
```
## Design and outputs

-   Course divided into two parts:
    -   Part 1: GIS tools
    -   Part 2: GIS analysis

In part 2 we shift from subject based to problem based learning....

Each practical answers a question....

::: fragment
> What are the factors that might lead to variation in Average GCSE point scores across the city?
:::

## Design and outputs

> It is not enough to simply give students some material and hope they will immediately learn it. **Learning happens by doing**

\

Weekly homework that we dedicate time to discussing

  * Week 1-5 tasks
  * Week 6-9 practice exam


## Design and output

##### Part 1: GIS tools...

> You need calculate the average percent of science students (in all) grades per county meeting the required standards and produce a map to show where the Country averages are above or below the State of Washington average.

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

##### Previous iterations

> Your task is to carry out a mini research project which answers a pertinent or topical geo-spatial question

::: fragment
::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
Students struggled to come up with a question, source data and apply it

-   Plagiarism

-   Poor applications

-   Very unbalanced reports

## What are we assessing? {.center}

## Can they apply the tools / methods with different scenarios and data ? {.center}

##  {.center}

### Practice exam (weeks 5-10), 10% {.center}

### Final exam (6 hour open book), 90% {.center}

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

##### Part 2: GIS analysis

\

##### Example practice question

> New York City wish to conduct a study that aims to prevent people being evicted through understand possible related factors.You have been enlisted as a consultant and tasked to conduct an analysis of their data from 2020.

Data:

-   [List of evictions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4)
-   [New York City community districts](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Community-Districts/yfnk-k7r4)

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

![](img/githubclassroom1.png){fig-align="center"}

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

GitHub classroom - setup

-   Create a template repository "submission"

-   Import to an "organisation" - shared folder that staff can access

-   GitHub classroom creates a URL for the template

![](img/template.png){fig-align="center" width="612"}

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

Students

-   Click the URL and generates a new repository

-   Staff can see their work and when they make edits (commit / push)

![](img/student_repo.png){fig-align="center" width="593"}

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

End of exam

-   Bulk download through the GitHub classroom desktop application

-   Run the student's code locally

-   See how often the student edited the code

![](img/assistant.png){fig-align="center"}

## Outcomes

#### Less (almost no) plagiarism

#### Marks have improved

#### All students learn to use reproducibility tools

#### The tool is not directly assessed

#### Global use and interaction with the resource

![](img/global_users.png){fig-align="center"}

## Current advancements

\

### New term 2 module - Remotely sensing cities and environments

#### Presentation hosted online - Xaringan

#### Weekly online portfolio - Quarto

## Conclusion

\

### Lead by example

\

### Tools become the norm

\

### Respond to industry requirements 

\


### Consider **what needs** assessing
